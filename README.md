## 3.0 Token Distribution & Allocation

The total supply of 1.5 billion MHW tokens is strategically allocated to ensure the project's long-term health and growth.

| Allocation Category | Percentage of Total Supply | Token Amount | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Presale Supply** | 40% | 600,000,000 MHW | Provides initial funding and gives early supporters a chance to acquire tokens. |
| **Ecosystem & Rewards** | 15% | 225,000,000 MHW | Funds staking/yield farming rewards, airdrops, and community initiatives to incentivize adoption and network participation. |
| **Liquidity** | 20% | 300,000,000 MHW | Establishes a robust and stable trading environment on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like PancakeSwap. The liquidity pool (LP) will be locked for a period of 12-24 months via a reputable third-party locker to ensure investor security and prevent a 'rug pull.' |
| **Development & Operations** | 14% | 210,000,000 MHW | Provides resources for ongoing product development, research, and general operational expenses. This allocation is subject to a strict vesting schedule. |
| **Team & Advisors** | 11% | 165,000,000 MHW | Aligns the core team's long-term interests with the project's success. This allocation will be subject to a 6-12 month cliff followed by a 24-36 month linear vesting schedule. |

## 4.0 Token Utility

The MHW token is engineered to be more than just a tradable asset; it is the engine that powers the Metahold ecosystem with a range of core use cases:

* **Governance:** MHW holders can participate in the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), allowing them to vote on key proposals and shape the future of the Metahold wallet.
* **Fee Reduction:** MHW can be used to pay for transaction fees within the wallet, offering a significant discount on cross-chain swaps and other premium services.
* **Staking Rewards:** Users can stake their MHW tokens to earn a passive income, contributing to network security and stability.
* **Exclusive Access:** Holding a specific amount of MHW may grant users access to premium features, early product releases, or exclusive NFT drops.
* **Deflationary Mechanism:** A portion of the fees generated from Metahold's services will be used to buy back and burn MHW tokens. This creates deflationary pressure, which is designed to increase the token's scarcity and value over time.
